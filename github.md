## Adding someone to the team

To add someone's github account to the team, they first need to be a part of communitiesuk. You can't do this, and they will need to request access through the helpdesk (link on the Sharepoint).

Then go to the [team page](https://github.com/orgs/communitiesuk/teams/local-policy-analysis) at and click "Add a member" in the top right. You should be able to add their account from the list. If you can't see them, they still need to be added to the github.
